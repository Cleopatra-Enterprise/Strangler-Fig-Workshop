/**
 * Package containing shared core classes that are used throughout the application. These classes are not specific to any particular

 * com.ces.slc.workshop.modules.knowledgebase}.
 *
 * <p>For example, the {@link com.ces.slc.workshop.modules.core.application.document.AbstractDocumentService} class is a base class for
 * document services in the application. It provides common functionality for creating, updating, and retrieving documents and their
 * components. The {@link com.ces.slc.workshop.modules.core.web.dto.DocumentDto} class is a template data transfer object that may be
 * implemented by other modules to represent documents in the application.
